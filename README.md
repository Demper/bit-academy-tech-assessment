# Bit Academy Tech Assignment


The test is written in Javascript, Css and HTMl. Best way to start the test is to open a terminal(command line) and navigate to the public folder of this project. Then execute the following command:

```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```
Which should result in the something like:

```
[...some date...] PHP 8.1.2-1ubuntu2.14 Development Server (http://localhost:8080) started
```

This means the build-in webserver of PHP is started and is listening on port 8080. Know open a browser of your choice(I tested this with the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome) and go to http://localhost:8080.
Resize the window to make the board fit the screen.

To play the Checkers game drag and drop the pieces on the field of your choice. It wil tell you whether it is a valid or invalid move based on the following rules:

- If you can strike you must strike!
- You can not move backwards but striking backwards is allowed!
- No more than one strike at the time.

White has the first move!

I dare you to finish at least one game!!!

Have fun,
Regards Rob
